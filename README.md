Quasi Micro Data Access Layer Du Jour (QuasiMicro?) hmm.. maybe that should be the name.

Ok, I started working on a MVC3 project and found that the size of EF (Microsoft Entity Framework) and it's over zealous attempt to be a one size fits all solution was just too much.  So this endeavour is born out of the need for something simple to use and easy to configure with all the usual goodness we as developers expect from a robust Data Access Layer.
